This repository contains a Python function designed to calculate the average of a list of numbers.  The function demonstrates error handling for empty lists and gracefully handles zero values.  However, it also highlights a common but easily overlooked TypeError that occurs when the list contains non-numeric values (e.g., strings).  The solution file shows improved error handling to prevent the TypeError. The original code exhibits a less obvious error that can lead to runtime exceptions if not handled properly. This is a good example of the importance of robust input validation when working with user-supplied data or data from external sources.
